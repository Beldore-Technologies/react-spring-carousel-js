# Features

- **Hedless Carousel**: a part from some needed div's (which you can override and customize), you're in total control on how the carousel will appear, bringing your own UI.
- **Highly customizable**: you can control what to render on every carousel item (and on every thumb item as well!).
- **Complete API availability**: either from the main **hook**, or either importing the own Carousel context, you can control the Carousel from every component if you need to.
- **Fullscreen implementation out of the box**: If you need to, `react-carouse-spring-js` exposes a method to enter/exit from fullscreen mode (we use [**screenful.js**](https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js/) under the hood for a better cross browser compatibility).
- **Auto Resize out of the box**: The carousel will resize & adapt correctly when the browser resizes. This is particular useful when `entering`/`exiting` the fullscreen mode or when the mobile direction changes.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-spring-carousel-js
```

or

```bash
yarn add --save react-spring-carousel-js
```

# Usage

At it's most basic, to start you can do:

```tsx
import { useReactSpringCarousel } from 'react-spring-carousel-js'

const { carouselFragment, thumbsFragment } = useReactSpringCarousel({
  items: [
    {
      id: 'item-1',
      renderItem: <ItemComponent />,
      renderThumb: <ThumbComponent />
    },
    {
      id: 'item-2',
      renderItem: <ItemComponent />,
      renderThumb: <ThumbComponent />
    }
  ]
})

return (
  <div>
    {carouselFragment}
    {thumbsFragment}
  </div>
)
```

As you can see, you don't have to call the component in the traditional way but instead the main **hook** return the **carousel fragment** (which is the carousel) and the **thumbs fragment** (which render the list of tumbs). It's up to you to decide **how** and **where** render boths, and they're not tied in any way, so basically you can customize the UI pretty much in any way you want to!

# Props

You can provide this **options** to better customize the behavior and the aspect of the Carousel:

| onItemChange               | `VoidFunction`                                                                                         | `() => {}`       | A `callback` triggered every time a item finish sliding (the callback is called inside the `onRest` react-spring method).                                                                                                                                            |
| shouldResizeOnWindowResize | `Boolean`                                                                                              | `true`           | Set to `false` if you don't want to resize the carousel when the browser resize. Remember that if you set `shouldResizeOnWindowResize` to false, when using the fullscreen mode the carousel will not adapt correctly after `entering`/`exiting` phases.             |
| draggingSlideTreshold      | `Number`                                                                                               | `50`             | Set the minimum treshold that is required to slide after the item is dragged and then released.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| enableThumbsWrapperScroll  | `Boolean`                                                                                              | `true`           | Set to false if you don't want to auto-scroll the list of thumbs when an item is selected. By default every time an item is selected and become the active one `react-spring-carousel-js` will automatically scroll the thumb wrapper list and will center the item. |
| CustomWrapper              | `React.ForwardRefExoticComponent<{ children: React.ReactNode } & React.RefAttributes<HTMLDivElement>>` | `undefined`      | If you want, you can provide a custom `element` that will be used as the main Wrapper element. Note that you can pass whatever element you want to, using whatever style pattern you want!                                                                           |

Note that you can pass whatever element you want to, using whatever style pattern you want!                                                                              |
